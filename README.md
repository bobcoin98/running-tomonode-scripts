## ‚öñ Load Balancing

We can run multiple nodes independently but using same coinbase address

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important note

Coinbase address is used to sign block and system transactions. Please create a new address to run a node, DONOT use existing address which have fund

We advise for security measures to use a fresh new account for your Masternode or 'coinbase address'. This is not the account that will receive the rewards. The rewards are sent to the account that will make the 50,000 TOMO initial deposit.
